Welcome to my sweet game called Burial Bandit.

To play it you need to install version `2.6.10` of the `arcade` library, and that's it, just run `game.py`, and you're off to the races.

The audio mix is quite loud, be careful with the volume.

P.S. There may occasionally be an IndexError relating to looking up animation frames when you launch the game, I apologise in advanced, but I could not reliably reproduce the error, so I couldn't fix it. It appeared that re-running the program a few times resolved the issue.
